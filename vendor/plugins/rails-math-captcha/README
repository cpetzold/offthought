MathCaptcha
===========

TODO: Create form helpers

Validates your Model to be saved by a human (or very clever script) by asking
the user to solve a very basic mathematical equation.

It does not use the session to store the secret, but uses AES from EzCrypto.


Requirements
============
 * gem ezcrypto
 * users who can calculate

Usage
=====

In your Model < ActiveRecord::Base

      has_captcha


In your form view:

      <%= @model.captcha.task %> = ?
      <%= form.text_field :captcha_solution %>
      <%= form.hidden_field :captcha_secret %>


If you want to skip the validation (in tests/specs), you can 

      Model.skip_captcha!   # or
      @model.skip_captcha!

and turn that off by

      Model.dont_skip_captcha!   # or
      @model.dont_skip_captcha!
